# 🎮 Managing Luigi's Inventory
# Alright, we learned new stuff. Now we’re going to use them to help Luigi manage his gear.

# Luigi is about to go find his brother, who was kidnapped by King Boo.
# He’s got a bag full of gear, and we need to help him organize it.
# We’ll be using lists to keep track of his inventory. Let’s get started!
#########################################################################################

# 🟢 Step 1: Create a list, called `inventory`, and add things that Luigi may need:
# For example:
# A Poltergust, a flashlight, a mushroom, a plunger, and a bone.
# Then print those items to make sure we put them in bag.

# ✂️ Step 2: Luigi is on his way to the Boo Woods, and he wants to check his bag.
# Print the first three items in his bag.

# So far so good. We pwned some ghosts, and we have some moneys to spend.
# 🛠️ Step 3: Let's upgrade the Plunger to a Golden Plunger!
# Hint: Use the index of the Plunger to change it to a Golden Plunger.
# Example: item[index] = "Golden Plunger"

# Nice! Now print that Golden Plunger to admire it.
# Also print the entire list one more time, I wanna see if everything is still there.

# While running through the woods, Luigi found a Super Star! Let's toss it in.
# ➕ Step 4: Luigi found a Super Star! Throw it in the bag.
# Hint : Use .append() to add it to the end of the list.
# OR
# use insert() to add it at a specific index, your choice.

# Oh look, a Dark Light Device! Let's put this at the front of the bag.
# Hint: Use .insert() to add it at index 0.

# Bling: Mushroom used!
# ❌ Step 5: Oops. Mushroom used — remove it.
# Hint: Use the .remove() method.

# Let's check our inverntory again.
# ...
# Oh no! We dropped the Bone, I must remove it from the list.
# Use the .pop() to make sure you're removing the correct item
# Hint: Store it in a variable, then print the popped item.

# 🔁 Step 6: Let’s go through his stuff one by one, to make sure that everything is here.
# Loop through the inventory and print the items one by one.

# 📏 Step 7: How packed is that bag?
# Hint: Use len() to see the size of the bag.

# Looks ok... but the order confuses me!
# 🔤 Step 9: Let’s get it sorted (alphabetically), then reverse it.
# No hint, you gotta work on your own now!



#########################################################################################
# 🧠 Recap:
# - You created an inventory of items
# - You managed to change, add, and remove items
# - You used slicing, loops, and sorting
# - You kept things organized no matter what happened on the way
# - You even reversed the order like a boss

# If you can’t help Luigi, then who can?! 🔥

# Bonus: Can you name all the methods you used in the recap?
