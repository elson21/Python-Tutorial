# Chapter 2

*Note*: Most of the code provided is commented out so that it doesn't get cluttered.  
        Remove the single `#` at each section that is divided by a bunch of `#`.

        e.g.
        ###################################
        # Bla bla bla, bla, bla bla.
        # Blablablablablabl!
        ###################################

        #my_list = [1, 2, 3]
        #print(my_list)

        ###################################
        # Woop woop listy list
        # Dictionary dictionary
        ###################################

        By removing the `#` before the list and the print statement you can run the code block.

Let’s upgrade our coding powers.  
There are 4 modules in this chapter, and it’s best to take them in order — they’re the building blocks of everything cool you’ll build later:

- **Lists**: the bread and butter of Python — order matters!
- **Dictionaries**: key-value pairs, like a phonebook that doesn’t suck.
- **Sets**: unordered, no duplicates, very fast for checking if stuff exists.
- **Tuples**: like lists, but immutable — the stone tablets of Python.

Each module comes with a nerdy little sister directory where things get practical:

- **Lists**: Managing Luigi’s inventory or squad.
- **Dictionaries**: A stats system for enemies or items in a game.
- **Sets**: Making sure no duplicate enemies or items get into your level.
- **Tuples**: Coordinates or fixed pairs like (x, y) — unchangeable and reliable.

When you're done, you'll be able to model real game data, RPG inventories, or even Pokémon stats — the kind of things real games and apps use.

## Chapter's project

Now that Luigi is smarter and can carry stuff, let’s make him do something useful!

**Luigi’s Inventory & Encounter System™️**

In this mini game you will:
- Use **lists** to manage Luigi’s inventory.
- Use **dictionaries** to represent enemies and items with stats.
- Use **sets** to keep track of unique enemy types he encounters.
- Use **tuples** for fixed map coordinates or power-up locations.

Luigi can:
- Explore a map (randomly generated or manually designed).
- Pick up items (if not already in his inventory).
- Fight enemies with stats (and take damage).
- Avoid duplicate items or enemies using sets.
- Move around in 2D using tuple coordinates.

**Goal**: Use all 4 data structures to create a dynamic, expandable mini adventure.

**Bonus** points for a loot system and level-up logic.  
**Double Bonus** if Luigi can die dramatically or gloat triumphantly.

## Grading

After finishing this chapter, use the following prompt to check your code quality and understanding:

    Prompt to paste into ChatGPT:

    "Here's my code for a mini-project using Python data structures. Please grade it like a fair but brutally honest CS professor. Rate it out of 10, tell me what sucks, what’s awesome, and what I should focus on next."
