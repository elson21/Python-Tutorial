# Chapter 1

*Note*: Most of the code provided is commented out so that it doesn't get cluttered.
        Remove the single '# at each section that is divided by a bunch of '#'

        e.g.
        ###################################
        # Bla bla bla, bla, bla bla.
        # Blablablablablabl!
        ###################################

        #henlo = 'Hello World!'
        #print(henlo)

        ###################################
        # Biribiri biri bi bi
        # Biri bi
        ###################################

        By removing the # before the variable henlo and the print statement you can run the code block

Let's learn the basics of programming. 
There are 3 modules in this chapter, that it's best to go over them, tweak them, run them, break them and fix them again.
It is important that you go over them in order.

- **Variables**: strings, numbers, booleans, constants
- **Conditionals**: if, if-else, elif, else
- **Loops**: for, while

Each module will have a nerdy little sister directory, that will show us why those things are needed with a micro-project:

- **Variables**: A character card with Mario's brother stats, Luigi.
- **Conditionals**: Luigi's moral compass, jump into action or stay home?
- **Loops**: Luigi fights the Goombas until he runs out of stamina (or was it patience?)

At the end of the module our big sis and bro will teach us how to put everything together and make our life easier.

## Chapter's project

Now that we know so much, let's build Luigi's own game!

**Luigi’s Adventure Simulator™️**
In this mini game you will have to:
- Store Luigi's stats by using variables
- Have the user choose what Luigi does based on conditions (fight, flee, or eat his mom's spaghetti?)
- Use loops to simulate turns or repeated actions (fighting enemies, walking through levels, etc.)

**Goal**: Use all 3 concepts (variables, conditionals, loops) in a tiny playable console adventure.
**Bonus** points for you if Luigi can lose or win.
**Double Bonus** if you create a chaos and fix it!

## Grading

After finishing this chapter, use the following prompt to check your code quality and understanding:

    Prompt to paste into ChatGPT:

    "Here's my code for a mini-project combining variables, conditionals, and loops. Please grade it a fair Python professor. Rate it out of 10, point out any mistakes or genius moments, and tell me what I should improve next. Be blunt but helpful."
