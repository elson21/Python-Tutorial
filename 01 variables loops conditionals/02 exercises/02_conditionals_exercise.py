# ðŸŽ® Mini Project: Luigiâ€™s Moral Compass

# Luigi woke up feeling something. Depending on his mood, he might do different things.
# Let's help him decide what to do today!

# 1. Get Luigi's mood from the user (e.g. mood = input("How you feeling today?").lower()). 
# 2. Ask if there is an enemy nearby (yes/no).
# 3. Ask if Luigi has a powerup (yes/no).
# 4. Based on the mood and the answers, print what Luigi will do today.
# 5. Use if/elif/else statements to handle different moods and situations.

# If you feel stuck, take a look at 02_conditionals.py for hints.
