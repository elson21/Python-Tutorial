# ðŸ¥Š Micro Project: Luigi vs The Infinite Goombas

# Luigi enters a never-ending field filled with Goombas.
# He starts with 100 stamina points.
# Every time he jumps on a Goomba, he defeats it but loses 7 stamina.
# After each Goomba, ask the player if Luigi should continue (yes/no).
# If the player says no, or if Luigi runs out of stamina, the battle ends.
# Print how many Goombas Luigi defeated and his final stamina.

# Bonus 1: Add a message when Luigi defeats a Goomba, showing his current stamina.
# Bonus 2: If Luigi's stamina drops below 20, print a warning message: "Luigi is getting tired!"
# Bonus 3: If Luigi's stamina drops below 0, print a message: "Luigi is out of stamina!"
