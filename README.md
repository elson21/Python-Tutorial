# Python Tutorial - Basics

Welcome to the chaos! This repo is where I document my journey learning Python from mistakes, breakthroughs, and all the “da fk is this?” moments.

## The Game Plan

I’m currently following the **MIT 6.100L - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python** (Fall 2022, by Ana Bell), and occasionally cheating with w3schools and AI when MIT decides to flex too hard.

This repo covers **just the Python basics**:

- ✅ Variables, loops, conditionals
- ✅ Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- ✅ List comprehensions
- ✅ Functions (normal & lambda – still wrapping my head around the latter)
- ✅ Error and exception handling (aka finding 101 ways to fail)
- ⏳ Recursion (currently fighting with this one)
- ⏳ OOP in Python: classes, objects, and inheritance (I’m not my parent class!)

> If I forgot something, it's probably because I haven’t suffered through it yet.

## 🧪 What’s in this repo?

- Oneshots for each module
- Code exercises from various sources
- Random practice scripts and experiments
- Some totally unnecessary comments in the code where I talk to myself
- Mini-projects if I’m feeling spicy

## What’s next?

Once I survive Python Basics™️, I’ll move to a new repo for:
- AI/ML stuff (starting with MIT’s Intro to Deep Learning)
- Scripting and backend nonsense
- Embedded systems (because why stop at software when I can break hardware?)

## 🛠️ Setup (if you wanna run my beautiful disasters)

- Python 3.x
- Any code editor (I’m using VS Code like pros do)
- Terminal (because I like suffering)
- Sometimes Windows, sometimes Linux (depending how fast my PC boots)

This is a work in progress, like me. So expect chaos, occasional brilliance, and a lot of `"TypeError: you fool"`.

Feel free to clone, fork, laugh, or cry along with me.
